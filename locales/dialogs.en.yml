    give: Oof, that are {0} warnings already, oopsie daisy!
    give_bot: Is this a joke? Are you a joke? I think you are. To prove how insignificant you are, I will
      just warn you instead. Better watch out now, you have {0} warnings, you human of little impact.
    give_self: I always thought that you were bad at self reflection, but it seems that you might have still some
      sense in that werd brain of yours. You now have {0} warnings.
    check: Oh snap, you've got {0} warnings in total! I finally did the course with Raj, you should have seen how confused he was!
    check_invalid: Oh snap, you've got {0} warnings in total! Earned if you ask me, you failed to type a number because "{1}" isn't one.

    quote: Man, such a stupid quote.
    quote_bot: 'You dare to quote stuff I never said? Well how about I quote you this: "Ohno, I have {0} warnings!"'
    quote_bot_warning: Quoted me for stuff I never said. What a twat.
    quote_self: You seem to be in love with yourself, aren't you?
    quote_empty: Well, I unfortunately dont know any quotes, but I am sure you will try to impress me hard with your intellect.
    missing_quotee: Quoted Person
    missing_quote: Quote

    command_not_found: You can't just yell at me and except that I know what to do. Tell me "{0}" and I will send you the pdf with all the commands.
    command_incomplete: Dundundun, you missed there something, bud! Thankfully I have made the missing part bold so
      that even your mental capacity can handle it!
    user_not_found: I searched and searched but found no one who is called like that. Are you sure that this isn't
      your imaginery wet-dreams friend you told me about in secrecy?

  help: You can't just yell at me and except that I know what to do. Soon I might tell you all commands, but I am not in
    the mood right now.
  warning:
    give: Oof, that are {0} warnings already, oopsie daisy!
    give_bot: Is this a joke? Are you a joke? I think you are. To prove how insignificant you are, I will
      just warn you instead. Better watch out now, you have {0} warnings, you human of little impact.
    give_self: I always thought that you were bad at self reflection, but it seems that you might have still some
      sense in that werd brain of yours. You now have {0} warnings.
    check: Oh snap, you've got {0} warnings in total! Soon I will visit this free MS Excel course that my friend Raj
      from India told me about. I might be able to create a cool table with the top most warning holders!
  error:
    command_not_found: Hold on, I did not get that. Why don't you take out that tasteless gum in your mouth that is
    supposed  to be your tongue and try that again.
    command_incomplete: Dundundun, you missed there something, bud! Thankfully I have made the missing part bold so
      that even your mental capacity can handle it!
    user_not_found: I searched and searched but found no one who is called like that. Are you sure that this isn't
      your imaginery wet-dreams friend you told me about in secrecy?

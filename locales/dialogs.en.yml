    give_bot: Is this a joke? Are you a joke? I think you are. To prove how insignificant you are, I will
      just warn you instead. Better watch out now, you have {0} warnings, you human of little impact.
    give_self: I always thought that you were bad at self reflection, but it seems that you might have still some
      sense in that werd brain of yours. You now have {0} warnings.
    check: Oh snap, you've got {0} warnings in total! I finally did the course with Raj, you should have seen how confused he was!
    check_invalid: Oh snap, you've got {0} warnings in total! Earned if you ask me, you failed to type a number because "{1}" isn't one.

      that even your mental capacity can handle it!
    user_not_found: I searched and searched but found no one who is called like that. Are you sure that this isn't
      your imaginery wet-dreams friend you told me about in secrecy?
